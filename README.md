# Coffee/Caffine Calculator 
This python program asks users to enter how many times a week they drink coffee. It then multiplies that input by the standard amount of caffine in a normal cup of coffee, and reports an average weekly caffine consumption. It draws attention to how much caffine adults consume daily without even realizing. It is also verybrelevant for college students, incluiding me, who live off of coffee, energy drinks, and other highly caffinated beverages. 

How to run: simply type in how many times a week, on average, you drink coffee. The program will do the rest of the work for you! 

Example run: 
How many times a week do you drink coffee? : 5

Got it! You drink coffee 5 times a week

That means you drink about 475 mg of caffine weekly! 
Anything to stay awake at work huh..

The program is meant to be relatable, simple, and helpful to any working adult or college student!
