# My First Busniess Python Program
# This is a comment line, python ignores it

#Use the print() function to display a messge
print("Welcome to busniess Python!")

#use variables to store numbers
#here, 'north revanue' is the label and 50000 is the number

north_revenue = 50000
south_revenue = 40000
east_revenue = 45000
west_revenue = 55000


#now lets calculate total revenue
#create another varible called 'total_revenue'
#its value will be all the numbers added up

total_revenue= north_revenue + south_revenue + east_revenue + west_revenue
#now display total revenue and everything together
print("Total Revenue: $", total_revenue)
